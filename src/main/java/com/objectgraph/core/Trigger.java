/**
 * Base class to use for reacting to {@link Event}s.
 * <p/>
 * Each time an {@link Event} reaches a {@link Node}, each Trigger registered to that Node gets checked and, if it is
 * the case, activated. To activate a Trigger, the method {@link #isTriggeredBy(Event)} has to return {@code true}. Upon
 * activation, the method {@link #action(Event)} is called. To access the {@link Node} connected with this Trigger, you
 * can use the {@link #getNode()} method, that returns the Node casted to the type used in the generic.
 * <p/>
 * A Trigger can <i>control</i> some properties, whose paths (relative to the Node that registered the Trigger) are given
 * by {@link #getControlledPaths()}. <i>Controlled</i> or <i>bound</i> properties are not restricted in any way, but you
 * can always ask a Node for its controlled properties, by using {@link Node#getControlledProperties()}. This would be
 * particularly useful in a GUI, for example.
 * <p/>
 * object-graph comes with some already implemented Triggers. See them as a reference or use them directly if they meet
 * your needs.
 *
 * @param <N> the subclass of {@link Node} returned by {@link #getNode()}
