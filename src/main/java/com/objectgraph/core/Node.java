/**
 * Main class of the Object-Graph Framework, provides event handling, error checking and more.
 * <p/>
 * This class provides various facilities to program in a dynamic and event-driven way
 * using standard Java objects, and provide easy access from UI. Subclasses of Node must implement:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A method that returns the names of the "local properties", through {@link #getProperties()}</li>
 * <li>Methods to get/set a local property: {@link #getLocal(String)}, {@link #setLocal(String, Object)}</li>
 * <li>A method to know the declared type for each property, {@link #getDeclaredPropertyType(String)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * In turn, the following services are provided:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Automatic dispatch of events through the graph defined by Node properties</dt>
 * <dd>Suppose that a Node, say X, has a property {@code "a"} which in turn references a Node Y with a property
 * {@code "b"}. If b is changed by using {@link #set(String, Object)}, an event is fired and gets propagated to Y
 * through the path "Y.b" and then to X through the path Y.a.b; any number of Triggers can be attached to
 * each Node, which are activated by a matching event. See below and {@link #addTrigger(Trigger)}.</dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Event handling made easy</dt>
 * <dd>For each Event that gets propagated to this Node, each registered Trigger is requested to check if an action is
 * required for that event. For example, if you want to bind a property, say {@code c}, to a transformation
 * of two other properties, say {@code a, b}, you can do this by putting the following line in the constructor:
 * <pre>
 * public NodeType() {
 *       :
 *       :
 *     addTrigger(new Dependency("c", "transform", "a", "b"));
 *       :
 *       :
 * }
 * </pre>
 * together with a protected or public method {@code transform()} that takes two arguments of the same type of a and b
 * and that returns the same type as c.</dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Constrained assignments</dt> <dd>TODO describe constrained assignments</dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Runtime error checking</dt> <dd>When using almost any kind of UI, the user of the interface
 * will enter inconsistent or wrong values for some property. In those cases, you don't want that an exception
 * stops the execution of the UI: instead, it would be great to show an error message with an useful description
 * of the problem. In any cases, if a Node is requested to achieve a computation, a first step would be to check
 * if there are some Errors in it and in this case provide the user a notification and stop the computation
 * until the problems are fixed. This can be obtained using {@link #addErrorCheck(ErrorCheck)}.</dd>
 * </dl>
