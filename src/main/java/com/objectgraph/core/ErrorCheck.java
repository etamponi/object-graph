/**
 * Base class for the hint-based error system
 * <p/>
 * To understand the usefulness of this class and of the hint-based error system, consider how you should solve configuration
 * errors when using a GUI or some other approaches that let the user set some parameters without the possibility of
 * compile-time error checking. You want that the user is notified in some way that the configuration options that her
 * has used are invalid, either because they're not valid one by one or they are not consistent with each other. When using
 * a GUI, you don't want that the program is interrupted or the workflow gets stopped, because the current configuration
 * might be a work-in-progress, as the user has still not completed it or has just messed around and don't know how to fix
 * things. You want that some hints appear, that help the user fix the errors in the configuration. Perhaps you want to
 * block some actions until the errors are fixed, but in general you don't want to throw exceptions or such things.
 * <p/>
 * In these cases, the hint-based error system may come in your help. By using {@link Node#addErrorCheck(ErrorCheck)} or
 * {@link Node#addConstraint(Constraint)}, you can add error checks to the configuration of the relative Node. For example,
 * consider a {@link ObjectNode} that has a property {@code percent} of type {@code int} and you want that property to stay
 * between 0 and 100. You can do the following:
 * <pre>
 *     public class Example extends ObjectNode {
 *         {@literal @}Property int percent;
 *
 *         public Example() {
 *             addErrorCheck(new RangeCheck("percent", 0, 100));
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * This way, you can still set {@code percent} with any integer, but if you invoke {@link com.objectgraph.core.Node#getErrors()},
 * or {@link com.objectgraph.core.RootedProperty#getErrors()} with a {@link RootedProperty} object connected with the "percent"
 * property, you obtain a set (or a map) of configuration errors. You could display it in
 * some way, by either showing it on an list view or by changing the color of the editor, or in any way you want.
 * <p/>
 * As any other {@link NodeHelper}, you can access the Node that registered the ErrorCheck through {@link #getNode()}.
 *
 * @param <N> The subtype of {@link Node} to which you want this ErrorCheck to be registered
 * @param <T> the type of value that we should check
